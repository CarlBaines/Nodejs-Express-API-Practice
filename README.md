# Nodejs-Express-API-Practice
A simple Node.js and Express API I made for practicing CRUD operations and RESTful routing.
Inspiration was taken from this video: <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MTSQjw5DrM <br>
I also used this video to help me learn how to seperate my routes into different files whilst maintaining the API's functionality: <br> https://youtu.be/0Hu27PoloYw?si=QhNBkSJgbbxbwO4d
